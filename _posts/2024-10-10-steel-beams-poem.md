# I dream of steel beams. (a poem)

This is a pretentious little poem I wrote about steel beams, non-living things and their role and value in everyday life.

###### (here's the story arc:

###### [Act 1 - Exposition](#act1),

###### [Act 2 - Rise](#act2),

###### [Act 3 - Climax](#act3),

###### [Act 4 - Fall](#act4),

###### [Act 5 - Catastrophe](#act5).

###### [Afterword - What was this and what's next for you?](act0))

## "I dream of steel beams"

<a name='Act 1 - Exposition'></a>
How I dream of steel beams,

woven webs of iron and coal,

a flowing grey stream -

and their tainted soul.

I dream of steel beams,

and their labyrinths cruel,

topped off with a false sheen,

they are concrete blocks immoral.

<a name='Act 2 - Rise'></a>
I dream of steel beams,

and the beams I dream of call to me:

"I know I may be at times stiff or rigid,

corporate, corrupt, reeking of spilled blood

but I am a feat to behold.

The same hands that sook fool's gold,

the same hands of vitriol and cold,

the same hands that shook with the foolish and the bold,

they built my snare, laid me bare to the air

and I, skyscraper, stand still, with all the same flare."

---

<a name='Act 3 - Climax'></a>
I dream of steel beams,

wrapping me in warmth,

I dream of steel reams,

apart of their creators faults.

---

<a name='Act 4 - Fall'></a>
I dream of steel beams,

and to the beams I dream of I say:

"Now I see, valiant marker,

of eras bygone and slates blanker,

you were witness to all that has been told,

to all that has been doled,

to all who through your streets have strolled

and to all who have foaled,

but your words, by luck, are stuck,

and your lips are always shut."

---

<a name='Act 5 - Catastrophe'></a>
I no longer dream of steel beams.

They are no longer novel or green.

They are standard, they are ordinary,

yet also magical and roaming free.

Looking up, I see intersections of alloy,

human achievements unrecognized, unseen,

a vulnerable building that will be one day destroyed,

yet I can't help but crack a smile that beams.

## Afterword - What was this and what's next for you?

Hey all 1 of you, hope you enjoyed this poem. It came from an idea I had that architecture like buildings and the like see so much, yet they keep quiet, and they can't do anything about it. Silent witnesses of humans being terrible people, as we always are. That's where the idea for the bizarre dialogue came from, too. The building also has feelings about what it has seen and what it can't do, and it lays them bare here.

What's next for me? Well, I'm probably gonna go game now, but one thing you might want to know is that I have ideas for several short stories I plan to eventually create. Expect those, uhh, pretty soon, maybe? I hope...

Anyways, signing off, iiiiiit's:
