# Some Haikus I Wrote + Quick Announcement

Hey guys, I didn't play games yesterday and today might just be the same. Don't know if it's burnout but it might be. 
Don't expect a Wot I Thought this week, it might not come. :( 

This article is ***a ~1 and a half minute read.***

## Here are some ominous haikus I wrote about some people when me and Samidy investigated a certain drama in the piracy subculture (iykyk). These are paired haikus. Enjoy!
---

power changes all,

even of valiant background,

falling high is grim.

power changes truth

and envy behind spun webs 

rears its ugly head.

---

some do not care for

drama bespoke, befuddled,

they prefer idling.

the layman's life is

by far easiest to live,

not of pettiness.

---

will his ego fell

community adored, and

shall his wrath hail down?

don't believe his lies

lest you end up tricked, his rule

obeying, reject.

## And how about some new ones?? Like for example, one about Clustertruck and one about Birdgut, two potential candidates for the next Wot I Thought.
---

of trucks and mayhem

a certain game consists of

yeah, it's pretty good!

---

malformed hero

ventures in avian guts

to save all from rule

---

## And one for a friend of mine.
---

please, bask in beauty,

child of ire yet gentleness

while you are able.

and, please, do not miss

the forest for the trees, child, 

calm down and rest, rest.
