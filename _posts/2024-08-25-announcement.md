## Announcement of what I'll be using this blog for
***

Hey, all, like, 1 of you, just wanted to post an update to this blog clarifying
what I'll use it for. You're likely gonna see three major types of post on here:
- "Wot I Thought"s, which are mid to long length reviews of games and (hopefully)
  other media; (in reference to Rock Paper Shotgun, WHY DID YOU CALL THEM WOT I THINKS?? YOU COULDA RHYMED IT!)
- some kind of weekly or monthly link post, which are posts highlighting cool links
  of the day/week/whatever on a blog; (Maybe Weekly Websites? Or Website Weekend?)
- miscellaneous stuff like some stuff I might be writing as a side-project or just for fun.

Aight, that's all, bye!
